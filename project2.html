                <h2>Introduction to the Problem</h2>
                <p>In the banking sector, precise loan repayment forecasting is essential for controlling credit risk and
                    profitability. Non-repayment of loans can result in substantial financial loss and
                    affect the stability of lending institutions. This project attempts to use data-driven insights to
                    predict whether borrowers will repay their loans based on their financial history and other
                    associated factors. By grasping these dynamics, lenders can make sound choices and customize
                    their approaches to reduce risk and encourage financial well-being.</p>

                <h2>Data Overview</h2>
                <p>This project uses a dataset Kaggle that contains various features that are pertinent
                    to loan repayment prediction. The objective is to predict loans as either fully paid or not, helping
                    an institution in credit risk management.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The reason for the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> The annual interest rate of the loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Policy:</strong> Whether the borrower met the credit underwriting criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>FICO Score:</strong> A measure of credit risk based on credit reports.</li>
                    <li><strong>Income:</strong> The borrower's annual income, indicating economic stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inquiries Last 6 Months:</strong> The number of inquiries on the borrowerâ€™s credit
                        report.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Status:</strong> The outcome of the loan (Fully Paid/Not Paid).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Access the dataset used for this analysis here: <a
                        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/some-dataset-link">Loan Data Dataset</a>.</p>

                <h2>Data Pre-processing</h2>

                <code>categorical_cols = loan_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
                </code>

                <p>This line of code selects all columns in the data set that are of type 'object', which typically
                    refers to categorical data in pandas. These columns are then given to the variable
                    categorical_cols. Categorical data is employed to describe variables with finite, fixed numbers of possible
                    values (also known as categories). For example, the 'purpose' column in your data, which has
                    categories like 'debt_consolidation' and 'credit_card', falls under this category. The reason for
                    identifying these columns separately is that most machine learning models require numerical input,
                    so categorical variables will often need to be transformed into a numerical format using techniques
                    like one-hot encoding or label encoding.</p>

                <code>numerical_cols = loan_data.select_dtypes(exclude=['object']).columns.drop('not.fully.paid')
                </code>

                <p>This line selects all columns not of type 'object', i.e., numeric data types. From this
                    selection, it then removes the column 'not.fully.paid' using the.drop() function. The reason for
                    exclude 'not.fully.paid' here might be because this column is typically treated as the target
                    variable (dependent variable) in a predictive model rather than as a feature (independent variable).
                    The rest of the columns, held in numerical_cols, will probably contain continuous or discrete
                    numerical values, which can directly be used for calculations and in statistical models.</p>

                <h2>Data Visualization and Insights</h2>
                <p>Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying patterns in the data. Below
                    are the visualizations created to explore relationships between various features:</p>

                <!-- FICO Score Distribution by Loan Status -->
                <pre>
                    <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/FICOhisto.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                </pre>
                <h3>Histogram of FICO Scores</h3>
                <p>This histogram shows the distribution of FICO scores among the loan applicants. FICO scores, which
                    are important determinants of creditworthiness, appear to be centered on mid-range values,
                    suggesting a moderate risk of default among the pool of borrowers. The distribution is fairly skewed
                    towards higher scores, consistent with the reality that a significant percentage of borrowers have good credit profiles,
                    which assists lenders in approximating the likelihood of loan defaults.</p>

                <h3>Bar Chart of Loan Purposes</h3>
                <p>The bar graph categorizes the loans in terms of their purposes, where 'credit card' and 'debt consolidation'
                    surfacing as the most common reason for borrowing. Such a trend captures a general interest among
                    borrowers to service outstanding debt or pay for credit card purchases, which may indicate wider
                    economic conditions or consumer trends. They are of value to financial
                    institutions to make their products and marketing strategies in alignment.</p>

                <h3>Scatter Plot of Annual Icome vs. Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
                <p> This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the logged annual incomes of the borrowers
                    and their debt-to-income ratios. The plot shows a wide dispersion of debt-to-income ratios across
                    various income levels, without any apparent trend that higher incomes have lower ratios.
                    This graph is useful for finding outliers and seeing how income levels affect or
                    pertain to financial management and borrowing needs.</p>

                <h2>Modeling</h2>
                <p>Logistic Regression was first selected in this research to resolve the binary classification
                    problem of determining if loans are repaid in full or not. Logistic Regression suits this
                    tasks since it explicitly models the probability of a binary event and therefore is a natural
                    and interpretable choice for binary classification problems. The model operates by fitting a
                    logistic function to a linear combination of input features, transforming the output into a
                    probability score between 0 and 1. The score is typically thresholded at some point (typically 0.5) to
                    classify observations into one of two categories. While beneficial for its simplicity and the
                    interpretive nature of its coefficients, Logistic Regression is limited by its assumption of a
                    linear relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of the dependent variable.
                    This can lead to underperformance if the relationships in the data are non-linear unless proper
                    transformations of data are undertaken.

                    Given these limitations, a RandomForestClassifier was subsequently implemented to better handle
                    potential non-linearities and provide a more robust approach, especially useful in the framework of
                    the imbalance in our dataset. Below is the code for training and testing the RandomForest
                    model:</p>

                <h2>Evaluation</h2>


                <p>The evaluation of the Logistic Regression model indicated that while it achieves high accuracy levels
                    (approximately 84% in training and test sets), these are potentially misleading due to
                    imbalanced character of the dataset. This imbalance led to a shift to the
                    RandomForestClassifier, whose performance was subsequently thoroughly tested. The RandomForest model
                    showed a better capability to manage the dataset, which was especially relevant considering
                    the low recall and precision that were faced with the Logistic Regression model for the minority class
                    of loans that are not paid in full. For instance, the correctness for the 'not fully paid' loans
                    under Logistic Regression was 25%, while the recall was lower at 2%, indicating that the
                    model was very conservative and did not account for the overwhelming majority of this important class. This failure
                    is serious in a financial environment where the cost of being wrong about a non-payment is high.
                    The RandomForestClassifier was created to improve upon these values with its capacity to model more
                    complex patterns without an assumption of linearity.
                    
                    In conclusion, the use of accuracy as a metric in imbalanced datasets can be deceiving, reflecting
                    the underlying class distribution more than the model's predictive capabilities. Metrics like the
                    F1-score, the balance of precision and recall, are significant, especially when they indicate great
                    improvement over the advanced modeling techniques employed, as observed in the classification
                    report produced by the RandomForest model.</p>

                <h2>Storytelling</h2>
                <p>The initial modeling with Logistic Regression indicated the inadequacy of identifying 'not fully
                    paid' loans and the need for advanced techniques. Transition to a RandomForestClassifier
                    had demonstrated its ability for better management of non-linear relations and coping with imbalances by its
                    ensemble approach. This adjustment quite significantly improved 'not fully paid' loan recall but
                    presented a trade-off with accuracy, highlighting the fine balance in predictive modeling.</p>

                <p>This development highlights the limitations of dealing with imbalanced data and emphasizes the
                    importance of continually refining the model. With the addition of advanced techniques like RandomForest
                    and fine-tuning the thresholds for classification, we've strived towards a model that is more aligned
                    with the dynamics of financial risk management. Every step in our modeling process brings us
                    closer to coming up with a sound tool that improves decision quality in financial lending.</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>The loan repayment forecasting project has significant social and ethical implications, some of which are beneficial and others detrimental. On the positive side, through enhanced loan repayment forecast accuracy, the project will allow financial institutions to reduce loan default risks, leading to safer banking operations and, consequently, lower interest rates for all borrowing due to less risk. Secondly, accurate predictions can enable lenders to offer consumers more tailored financial products, furthering financial access for under-banked segments that would otherwise be scored as too great a risk.</p>

                <p>However, with the benefit comes potential adverse consequences. Relying on stale data within a predictive model permits earlier prejudices to persist. If the data reflects discriminatory patterns of lending in the past or socioeconomic biases, the model would be perpetuating these practices unwittingly by biased instead of merit-based grounds, denying loans to certain groups or individuals. This would further solidify social disparities and restrict economic mobility. Additionally, invasion of privacy is a possibility because sensitive personal financial data is being used and processed, presenting threats to data security and data breach. Ethically, there is also the issue of transparency; borrowers do not know how their loan applications are determined, which can lead to distrust in financial systems.</p>
                    
                <p>Generally speaking, as much as the project aims to implement technical innovations to loan repayment projections, it must be treated with a keen appreciation of its broader social and moral implications. That it must avoid the unfair use of algorithmic decision-making and maintain robust data protection mechanisms in place is paramount to the prevention of this project's negative impact.</p>
